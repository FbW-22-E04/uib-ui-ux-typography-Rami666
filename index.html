        <h4>By Robert Bringhurst</h4>
        <p>
          Often referred to as <strong>"The Typographer's Bible,"</strong> Chapter 6 of The
          Elements of Typographic Stylecovers Choosing and Combining Type.
          Bringhurst reminds us to "Choose faces that will survive, and if
          possible prosper, in the final screen conditions" and to "choose faces
          that suit the task as well as the subject." He tells us to "start with
          a single typographic family," but when the time comes to combine
          fonts, "balance the type optically more than mathematically."

  <h3><a href="https://fonts.ilovetypography.com/" target="_blank">I Love Typography</a></h3>
  <h4>By John Boardley</h4>
  <p>
    From the website: I love Typography (ILT)
    was born on August 7, 2007. It exists because I have a passion for
    typography, type design, and lettering, and for the words born of
    those disciplines. As a child I wondered why the teacher asked us to
    draw the letter a as an o with a tail, when in my books, the a’s had
    an extra bit at the top. This site aims to make the subject more
    accessible, to bring the study of typography to the masses, if you
    will. It's just about impossible to imagine a world without type, but
    at the same time type's ubiquity has most of us taking it for granted.
    So take a closer look." ilovetypography.com

  <h4>By Ben Shahn</h4>
  <p>
    Ben Shahn was a muralist, photographer, and printmaker whose work
often including lettering. When he was 14, he was apprenticed to a
lithographer. In
Love and Joy About Letters he writes: "I
discovered the Roman alphabet in all its elegance and its austere
dignity, and I fell in love all over again with letters… Letters are
quantities, and spaces are quantities, and only the eye and the hand
can measure them. As in the ear and the sensibilities of the poet
sounds and syllables and pauses are quantities, so in both cases are
the balancing and forward movement of these quantities only a matter
of skill and feeling and art."
